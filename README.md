### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kajus and I'm 21 years old.
I am currently studying at 42berlin.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about distributed systems, serverless architecture, Rust, C and Flutter
- âš¡ I especially enjoy low-level coding and creating backend systems
- ðŸ“– My journey began with Java in 2018. Since then I have learnt Dart/Flutter in 2022, Rust in 2023 and at the end of 2023 during my piscine at 42berlin I began to learn C/(C++).
  - Since then I have...
  - created a diary webapp with images, video, text and timeline (Flutter+Rust)
  - looked into creating a 'TeamSpeak Client' clone (Dart) where I learned tons about networking protocols & encryption
  - tested my knowledge about encryption by porting bouncycastle's EAX algorithm (Java) to Dart which was [merged](https://github.com/bcgit/pc-dart/pull/166) into [bcgit/pc-dart](https://github.com/bcgit/pc-dart)
  - created a [neat Valorant hack](https://github.com/kjzl/valorant-instalock) (Rust) which automatically picks and locks your preferred agent before the players are even loaded into the game
  - created multiple iterations of an appointment sniper app (Java/Rust) for booking appointments at the berlin government (https://service.berlin.de/) which are otherwise nearly impossible to get
  - created several Teamspeak Bots (Java/Rust)
  - created several Minecraft plugins (Java)
